description : "I am a deeply committed & resourceful troubleshooter with a commendable work ethic and 13 years of transferable work experience in a variety of industries that focus on quality customer service including administrative assistance, technical support, restaurant & bar services, education, social work, and community planning; seeking full-time employment to implement my well developed technical skills, and gain knowledge in areas out of my expertise in order to grow within a stable company.


In December of 2021, I decided to take a leap of faith and shift into a career in tech. After being a social worker for 7 years, I was eager to follow my passion to be a software engineer. To equip myself with the right professional and technical skills, I decided to move from Philadelphia, PA to Tulsa, OK in order to attend an accredited vocational coding school, Holberton School Tulsa. It was during my 12-month, full-time program that I developed a skillset in computer science and programming, and more specifically in DevOps Engineering."
